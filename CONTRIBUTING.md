## Starting out:

### When starting with to work on this project there are a number of recommendations that it is advised you follow:

1. Try and make your self familiar with the code before trying to do work on it as in sufficient knowledge breeds program braking mistakes.
2. If there is a bit of code that you don't understand for whatever reason please join our discord and as a dev on there discord link: https://discord.gg/Tdy8Twf
3. Make sure you can code at the level that the code is and if you don't know code to that level try and use the comments to understand what is going on and/or look it up.
4. Try to avoid spamming commits and pull requests it is also a good idea to create a draft pull request of your code to the branch it originates from so others can with greater ease spot errors or mistakes and help you to fix them.
5. Try and well comment your own code and maybe even add comments to the code of others if you understand it to make it easier for others to read.

## Experienced contributors:

### Basic stuff that people just forget to do or slip out the habit of doing:

1. Don't make non draft pull requests for stuff you know isn't done yet.
2. Don't keep a large load of commits locally try and put them on a branch as you go to allow people to be able to view and fix your code as you go also means less time with bug testing before your PR is merged.
